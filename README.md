# Multiplier Comparison: Wallace Tree vs Booth's Algorithm (FPGA Implementation)

This project presents a comparative study between two 16-bit multipliers â€” **Wallace Tree Multiplier** and **Booth's Multiplier**, both designed in Verilog and implemented on the **Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA** using Vivado. The work was conducted under the guidance of *Prof. Janakiraman Viraraghavan* as part of the IIT Madras Summer Fellowship Programme (May 2025). The idea was to explore real-world multiplier trade-offs for small-scale embedded arithmetic cores. Prof. Janakiraman was exploring optimization paths for datapaths in energy-aware designs, and this helped support that evaluation by giving concrete FPGA data.


## Objective

To compare the two multipliers based on:
- Power consumption
- Timing delay
- Area (LUT/FF usage)

## Conclusion

- **Wallace Tree** offers higher speed due to parallelism but uses significantly more resources.
- **Booth's Multiplier** is compact and efficient in area, better for low-power embedded cores.
